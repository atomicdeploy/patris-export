# Windows Resource Files

This directory contains Windows resource (.rc) files that provide version information for Windows executables.

## Files

Currently, this directory only contains this README. The patris-export executable resource file is located at `cmd/patris-export/patris-export.rc`.

For the pxlib.dll library, we use the upstream version information from the pxlib project itself, which is automatically configured during the build process.

## Usage

Resource files are automatically compiled by the build workflows:
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - MinGW cross-compilation from Linux to Windows
- `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` - Windows MinGW build (native on Windows)

The resource files are compiled using `windres` (Windows Resource Compiler) and embedded into the executables/DLLs during the build process.

## Updating Version Information

For patris-export:
- The file `cmd/patris-export/patris-export.rc` is now automatically generated by the build process and should not be manually edited. It is also listed in `.gitignore`.
- To update version information, modify the relevant source/version configuration files (see project documentation for details), then run the resource generation script (e.g., `scripts/generate-patris-export-rc.sh` or the appropriate build command) to regenerate the `.rc` file.
- Rebuild the project as usual after regenerating the resource file.

For pxlib:
- Version information comes from the upstream pxlib project and is automatically configured by CMake during the build.
